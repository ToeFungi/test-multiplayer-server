# Socket.IO
Experimenting with socket.io. The library can be found [here](https://socket.io/)

## Getting Started
Clone the repository
```bash
$ git clone git@github.com:ToeFungi/socket-io.git
$ cd socket-io
$ npm i
```

## Running App
You can now use `nodemon` to run the server which will allow socket connections.
```bash
$ npm run server
```
You can open up the `index.html` within `client/` which will create a connection to the server.
